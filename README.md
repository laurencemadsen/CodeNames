# CodeNames-1
 My implementation of the card game Code Names (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)) in C# using Unity. This was done as an assignment to practice agile programming with the twist of using a language you've never used prior. We were given two weeks to create a project in two sprints and the result is this. 
 
 ## Running
 1. Download the zip of the repository
 2. Unzip
 3. Run the executable named  "Codenames"
 4. enter 4 unique player names
 5. click the small board icon next to the hint input to show the different team's cards (color coded)
 6. create a hint (must be a valid hint meaning a single word in the first box and a number of cards it applies to in the second)
 7. click the relevant cards
 8. play through the game 
 9. To quit you just close the program
